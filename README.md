# Portfolio-website

This is a general portfolio website I have not hosted yet but, plan to in the near future when I have a good amount of it finished.


As of now I am currenlty using it to practice my HTML/CSS skills. The webiste adopts some of the design styles of Apple and has some of the same font styles to help me push it in a direction I like stylistically later. The Apple-esque design now is just a base for me to build on creatively so it may evolve (probably de-evlove) into something crazier later. 



Works in Progress:
| - Using the Spotify Web API to integrate a Top Artist's , What I Listening to? , and an embedded Playback app using Javascript. ( Still working on fixing mistakes I |made)
| - Working on Side project to add in the 'Projects List' 
| - Mocking up a Design to make an integrated 'Resume Page'  ( This may be integrated onto the 'Welcome Screen' or an entirely different page on the website)


Working on now:

- Learning how to use Web API's to make a personalized integrated Spotify embedded player and gather data from my most recently played tracks and top artists.
