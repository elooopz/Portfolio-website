# Portfolio-website

This is a general website I have not hosted yet but plan to in the near future.


As of now I am currenlty just practicing my HTML/CSS skills by making a design that follows an Apple-ish design. 



Works in Progress:
| - Using the Spotify Web API to integrate a Top Artist's , What I Listening to? , and an embedded Playback app using Javascript. ( Still working on fixing mistakes I |made)
| - Working on Side project to add in the 'Projects List' 
| - Mocking up a Design to make an integrated 'Resume Page'  ( This may be integrated onto the 'Welcome Screen' or an entirely different page on the website)
